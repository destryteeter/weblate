"THIS IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH.\n"
"Decades of research indicate that having quality social connections with "
"other people is critical for good physical and mental health. In fact, "
"the health benefit of having quality social connections is comparible to "
"what you would obtain by stopping smoking or maintaining a healthy body "
"weight. Studies have found that social support is linked to recovering "
"faster from injuries and more effective immune system functioning.\n"
"\n"
"IT'S GOOD FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS.\n"
"Recent research indicates when people provide support and help for "
"others, it improves their own well being. Importantly, the health "
"benefits of giving to others seems to increase with age.\n"
"\n"
"THE BIG PICTURE.\n"
"This service helps maintain social connections between people and the "
"friends and family in their Trusted Circle, all of whom may experience "
"health benefits from being socially connected and giving to others.\n"
"\n"
"HOW DO I SET UP THE TRUSTED CIRCLE?\n"
"First, add people in the {} app's Trusted Circle tab. Make sure at least "
"one person's Alert Texting role is set to 'I Live Here'. Set other "
"people's Alert Texting roles to either 'Family / Friend' or 'Social "
"Reminders Only'. {} will then intelligently coordinate family and friends"
" in the Trusted Circle to reach out to the people who live here.\n"
"\n"
"HOW DOES IT WORK?\n"
"Each participant will get randomly selected no more than once per week in"
" a way that does not become a burden. On that person's day to reach out, "
"they will receive a text message reminder in the morning. Finally, {} "
"will help recommend conversation topics to the next person in the Trusted"
" Circle, and report on the Dashboard who reached out most recently."
