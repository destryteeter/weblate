"IT'S GOOD FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS.\n"
"Recent research indicates when people provide support and help for "

"This service helps maintain social connections between people and the "

"health benefits from being socially connected and giving to others.\n"
"\n"
"HOW DO I SET UP THE TRUSTED CIRCLE?\n"
"First, add people in the {} app's Trusted Circle tab. Make sure at least "
"one person's Alert Texting role is set to 'I Live Here'. Set other "

" a way that does not become a burden. On that person's day to reach out, "
